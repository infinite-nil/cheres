## The challenge

At Cheres, we display personalized insights of our users' portfolio. This could be related to their stock portfolio, the gas fees they've spent on their crypto transactions or analytics such as the performance of specific assets they hold.

We want users to consume this data in a simple and efficient way, so we've designed a stacked card component to display these insights on our home screen. You can find the design of the component on the right side of this file.

The objective of the challenge is to bring this design to life using React Native given the requirements and deadline listed below.

## Requirements

When it comes to the minimum acceptance criteria, users should be able to:

- Generate new insights each time they tap on the card
- Be able to read a descriptive piece of text with an insight that is related to their portfolio on each card
- See an emoji or any other type of media that is relevant to the particular insight that is being displayed
- Have at least 3 unique insights they can loop through

**Feel free to mock any data or API calls you deem necessary, as well as to make any assumptions you feel are appropriate, as long as they are all properly documented.**
